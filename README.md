# inanis

## requirements
I've personally tested inansis on both Windows 10 and MacOS, however it was built from the ground up to be cross-platform compatible. That being said, it does require some modules that *currently* **do not** self install upon starting inansis, but you will be warned on what isn't installed.

* psutil
> pip3 install psutil

## purpose
inanis is designed to be a lightweight and very fast python program to divulge import system information.
